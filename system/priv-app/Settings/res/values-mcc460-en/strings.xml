    <string name="dialog_message_hint">"STAMINA mode includes:

• Extended standby
Saves power when the screen is off by temporarily disabling WLAN and mobile data. Most applications will be inactive.
When the screen is ON, your phone will function normally.
If you want to keep some apps active while Extended standby is ON, add the apps to the APPS ACTIVE IN STANDBY list.

• Extended usage
Saves power when your device is in use by restricting hardware performance.
"</string>
    <string name="dialog_message_no_extended_usage_hint"><u>What is STAMINA mode?</u>"
STAMINA mode is a Sony™ power save function. It extends battery lifetime by disabling functionality while the screen is off.

"<u>Basic usage</u>"
To activate STAMINA mode, use the switch on the next screen. 
When the screen is off, all network data will be disabled temporarily, and most of your applications will be inactive, to save battery.
When the screen is on, your device will function normally.

"<u>Advanced usage</u>"
If you want to keep some apps active when the screen is off, just add them to the APPS ACTIVE IN STANDBY list.

"<u>Note</u>"
Some applications may not work properly when disabled in standby. If an application does not work properly, add it to the APPS ACTIVE IN STANDBY list, or if this does not work, deactivate STAMINA mode."</string>
