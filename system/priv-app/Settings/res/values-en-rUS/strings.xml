STAMINA mode is Sony’s power save function. It extends the battery lifetime when the display is off.

"<u>Basic usage</u>"
To turn on STAMINA mode, tap the button on the screen.
When the screen is off, in order to save battery life, Wi-Fi and mobile data will be temporarily disabled, and most applications will be inactive.
When the screen is on, your phone will function normally.

"<u>Advanced usage</u>"
If you want to keep some apps active while STAMINA is on, please add the apps into the APPS ACTIVE IN STANDBY list.
Applications may not work correctly if they are not added to the list.

"<u>Note</u>"
If an application doesn’t work correctly, please register the app in APPS ACTIVE IN STANDBY or turn off STAMINA mode."</string>
